# Predator-Prey-Simulation

Remake I made of a Tandon Bridge homework assignment I had. The idea is to make a predator(X)-prey(O) simulation on a 20x20 grid, whereby the predator (doodlebug) eats the prey, breeds and dies if it cannot eat for too long, and the prey (ants) breed and die if eaten by the predator. With the given input parameters of the breeding/starving intervals a cyclic pattern is seen between predators dominating the board and prey dominating the board.
